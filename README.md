# McCreebot

------

A class project: McCreebot is a discord bot with fixed conversations + a magic 8ball interaction and a dice roller. His interactions are based around the character Jesse McCree from Blizzard's first person shooter "Overwatch".

------

  McCreebot uses the prefix " m! " before all commands.

  His current available commands are as follows:
    
    m!calls
      Lists all the conversation starters available.
    
    m!roll
      Allows the user to roll any number and type of dice. For example, typing in " m!roll 10d20 " will have McCreebot respond with " You rolled: 9,19,1,10,7,11,11,13,14,2 ". 
    
    m!8ball
      Allows the user to input the command followed by a phrase that McCreebot will respond to.
